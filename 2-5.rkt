;; Observations: If cons is a number n such that n = 2^x for integer x > 1,
;; then the cdr is 0. Likewise, if itâ€™s n = 3^x for integer x > 1, then the car
;; is 0.

;; If cons is 1, then both car and cdr are 0.

;; I assume that there is only one possible car and cdr for any given cons.

;; Note that cons need not to be able to assume any positive integer value. It
;; just needs to hold a positive integer value that can _map_ to any pair of
;; positive integer values.

;; But back to the observation. We know that if cons is not 1 or an exponential
;; of 2 or 3, then the car and the cdr are both greater than 0, so we can
;; reduce our problem down.
