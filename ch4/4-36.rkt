;; In our sequential computational model, we evaluate amb by choosing the first
;; option given, and backtrack if the path terminates via (amb). With three
;; ambs in sequence, and each amb having infinite choices, if the computation
;; terminates on one branch, the backtracking will pick the next choice in the
;; last fork. But since there are infinite paths at that (and every) fork, if
;; the newly chosen branch terminates too, we will continue trying other paths
;; at the same fork, effectively only trying to change one of the three values
;; to satisfy the Pythagorean condition.

;; Basically, depth-first search + infinite paths at last fork = doom.

;; Strategy is to reverse the order of the lets such that all but the first
;; fork have finite branches to traverse through.
