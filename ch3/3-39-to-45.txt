Edit: 11 too?

P1_A_B, P2_A_B_C_S, P1_S: 100

And many more permutations that return the same values. Suffice to say,
this is unmanageable.

Were it serialized, only 1,000,000 is a possibility.

3.41:
With or without serialization of withdrawal and deposits, there shouldn't
be a need to serialize read access of account balance because it cannot
affect the other processes, even if it interleaves with them.

3.42:
The problem with this is that while different serialized procedures behave
the same in a concurrency situation, a procedure can be interleaved with
another of its kind. For instance, withdrawals can be interleaved with
other withdrawals.
Edit: Consensus says I'm wrong. There's no issue with Ben's code.

3.43:
After any number of serial exchanges, the only numbers to swap are 10, 20, and
30, so it stands that those are the only balances that are possible.

This condition is violated in the following scenario:
A: $0, B: $100, C: $0

1. A and B accessed to compute diff of -100.
2. B and C accessed and swapped. B now $0, C now $100.
3. A withdrawn -100, now $100.
4. B deposited -100, now -$100.

End balances:
A: $100, B: -$100, C: $100

Notice that this still preserves the total amount among the accounts (even if
some balances don't make sense). This is because the assignments of the
account balances are always by difference of their current balance to the
amount specified, rather than atomic set! operations.

Were individual accounts not serialized, then there could be interleaving such
as this:
A: $0, B: $100, C: $99999
1. For exchange(A, B), diff is computed to be -100.
2. For withdraw(A, -100), A is accessed, and set to $100.
3. For deposit(B, -100), B is accessed ($100) to compute 0.
4. exchange(B, C) starts and completes. B now $99999, C now $100.
5. B is set to $0.

End balances:
A: $100, B: $0, C: $100

There is now $99,899 missing.

3.44:
(define 
  (transfer from-account to-account amount)
  ((from-account 'withdraw) amount)
  ((to-account 'deposit) amount))

Because the amount is "precomputed" (in the sense that it is decided ahead of
time, not during execution), there is only one step[1] to this procedure,
versus the two steps in the exchange procedure.

[1] While there are two statements in the step, each are secure in that they
produce the same effect whether another action on the account occurs before
or after (provided no overdraft occurs).

3.45:
If the serialized withdraw and deposit procedures are exported, then calling
a serialized exchange procedure would have those serialized withdraw/deposit
procedures within its body, which wouldn't run since they're in the same
serialized set. The execution would hang.
