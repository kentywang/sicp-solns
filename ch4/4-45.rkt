;;; Tests

(parse '(the professor lectures to the student in the class with the cat))

;; Observations: the code is actually quite deceiving. The ambs for the parse-
;; noun-phrase and parse-verb-phrase actually get called AFTER its preposition
;; amb is processed, meaning that we don't quite do a depth-first search. This
;; behavior is quite necessary because DFS would actually cause the search to
;; continuously try parsing nested prepositional phrases, so it would never
;; quite backtrack to try other possiblities earlier in the chain.

;; Local testing fails to find other paths because the amb isn't reversing
;; the assignments like it's supposed to when trying a different route.

;; Actually, I still don't quite get how the amb works. Even with the
;; wrapping amb from the parent component, it doesn't look like it should
;; backtrack.

;; Hmm, I think we don't get an infinite recursion down the first verb phrase
;; parsing because on the first backtrack we don't reverse any assignments, so
;; the *unparsed* is still empty. Therefore, when we try and parse the overly
;; nested verb phrase's preposition, we are halted before calling another amb,
;; so then we backtrack out of the verb phrase and into its child prop's noun's
;; amb fork.
